## What is Circuit theory model:
- Normal stuff like Ohm's law, KCL, KVL, etc.
- Used when![[Pasted image 20220518122359.png]]

## What is Lumped circuit model:
- Idk what that exactly is
- 
 > Lumped elements: Voltage and current do not vary appreciably along physical dimension of elements along the network.
- Used when 
- ### Network's physical dimensions ~= electrical wavelength



## Where does Transmision line comes into play?
- Transmission linesâ€™s size are considerable fraction of a wavelength or many wavelengths in size.
- i.e, The size of the circuit(transmission line circuit) is ~= electrical wavelength.
- So most of the time, we use the Lumped circuit model for Transmission line circuits.







# Question:
- [[Circuit theory approach vs Transmission lines]]
