## What is a Transmission Line
![[Pasted image 20220518123357.png]] 

Basically a transmission line is a signal carrier (wire).


## Lumped circuit model:
- Transmission lines are represented as two-wire line (Transmission lines prefer TEM- transverse electromagnetic wave propagation[The defenition of TEM is big, but basically remember that for a 3D object, if we use TEM, one component will be zero, most of the time, that will be the z] which have atleast two conductors. 
• As transmission lines smaller in size, comparable with the operational wavelengths, we cannot apply the lumped-element circuit directly. 
• However, the lumped-element circuit is applicable only when we consider a piece of line of infinitesimal length 𝚫𝒛 as shown below.

- In Lumped circuit mode, a transmission line is transformed to a normal circut

## Derivation of Telegrapher Equations:
- Applying KVL,

- Dividing the expression by Δz,

- ![[Pasted image 20220518124803.png]] ==> Equation - 1
- Similary, using KCL we get the partial differentiation of current with respect to time

Equations 1 and 2 are known as **Telegrapher's Equations**

## Wave propagation on a Transmission Line
****This is going to be some heavy derivation**

- For sinusoidal steady state condition, with cosine based phasors![[Pasted image 20220518125830.png]]

		Each line is next thing we did to the previous line

- By solving simultaneously – **Wave equations for Vz and Iz** are obtained: ![[Pasted image 20220518130333.png]]
